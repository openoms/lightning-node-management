To create inbound liquidity on an existing channel \(to be able to receive payments\) can simply pay a merchant accepting Lightning and receive the product or receive the sats back on-chain.

## Dual funded channels
### Core Lightning dual funded channels on the protocol level
* [How to use on the RaspiBlitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/blob/dev/FAQ.cl.md#dual-funded-channels)
* [Open a dual funded channel](https://medium.com/blockstream/c-lightning-opens-first-dual-funded-mainnet-lightning-channel-ada6b32a527c)

## Buy inbound channels
### Comparison table of lightning channel markets
* [channelmarkets.md](https://github.com/openoms/lightning-node-management/blob/en/channelmarkets.md)

### [Amboss Magma](https://amboss.space)
* lightning liquidity marketpalce

### [zerofeerouting.com](https://zerofeerouting.com/)
* The price for the channel depends on the size and can be calculated as:
  ```
  [size] * 0.005 - 2,000
  ```
  A 10M channel (0.1 BTC) would cost 48,000 sats.

## Swap out - trustless

Pay with Lightning and receive onchain.

### [Lightning Loop](https://github.com/lightninglabs/loop)

Lightning Loop is a non-custodial service offered by Lightning Labs to bridge on-chain and off-chain Bitcoin using submarine swaps.

In the current iteration of the Loop software, two swap types are supported:

* Loop Out: off-chain to on-chain. The Loop client sends funds paid on Lightning to a Bitcoin address.
* Loop In: on-chain to off-chain. The Loop client sends funds paid on-chain to a Lightning channel.
* Max swap amount: 4 200 000 sats
* Example usage for lowest cost \(leads to longer confirmation time \(estimation for 25 blocks\) and higher failure rate \(max routing fee 500 sats\) - adjust the numbers accordingly\):  
  `loop out --conf_target 25 --max_swap_routing_fee 500 4200000 [optional external address]`

  ```text
     loop out [command options] amt [addr]

    # --channel value               the 8-byte compact channel ID of the channel to loop out (default: 0)
    # --addr value                  the optional address that the looped out funds should be sent to, if let blank the funds will go to lnd's wallet
    # --amt value                   the amount in satoshis to loop out (default: 0)
    # --conf_target value           the number of blocks from the swap initiation height that the on-chain HTLC should be swept within (default: 6)
    # --max_swap_routing_fee value  the max off-chain swap routing fee in satoshis, if let blank a default max fee will be used (default: 0)
    # --fast                        Indicate you want to swap immediately, paying potentially a higher fee. If not set the swap server might choose to wait up to 30 minutes before publishing the swap HTLC on-chain, to save on chain fees. Not setting this flag might result in a lower swap fee.
  ```
