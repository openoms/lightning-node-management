# Set up a Watchtower and a Client on the Lightning Network

A watchtower monitors the bitcoin blockchain for any transaction attempting to steal from its client by closing a channel with a previous, invalid state. If a breach is found the watchtower immediately broadcasts a punisher transaction moving all funds in the channel to the on-chain wallet of its client.

If there are two nodes in your control from lnd v0.7.0 you can set them up to look out for each other. Best to be done with nodes in two separate physical location so any unexpected loss of contact can be covered for.

## Update lnd

Check [https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/) for the latest version and release notes. Update [manually](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#installing-lnd) or use an [automated helper script](../technicals/lnd.updates.md) to update lnd on a RaspiBlitz or a compatible system.

## Set up the Watchtower

Run the commands in the node\`s terminal  
`#` stands for `$ sudo`

* Change the lnd.conf:  

  `# nano /mnt/hdd/lnd/lnd.conf`

* insert the lines on the end of the file:

  ```text
  [Watchtower]
  watchtower.active=1
  ```

  * the watchtower listens on the port 9911 by default, but can be set to any other unused port with: `watchtower.listen=0.0.0.0:PORT` in the config file.
  * The IP address `0.0.0.0` is used to accept connections from everywhere \(default setting\)

* allow the port through the firewall:  
`# ufw allow 9911 comment "watchtower"`  
`# ufw enable`
* restart lnd `# systemctl restart lnd`
* forward the port 9911 on the router
* Check in the log if the service is working:  
  `# tail -n 10000 /mnt/hdd/lnd/logs/bitcoin/mainnet/lnd.log`

    ```text
    [Wtclient]

  * Add a watchtower from the command line \(can add multiple one-by-one\):

    ```text
    $ lncli wtclient add <watchtower-pubkey>@<host>:9911
    ```

  * Use the `watchtower-pubkey` noted previously from `$ lncli tower info`.
  * For a clearnet client the `host` needs to be the clearnet IP \(or dynamicDNS\) of the watchtower even if the watchtower is running behind Tor. 
* Restart lnd  
`# systemctl restart lnd`
* Check in the log if the service is working:  
  `# tail -n 100 /mnt/hdd/lnd/logs/bitcoin/mainnet/lnd.log`

  Sit back and enjoy that now there is no way to cheat your node even when it is offline!

## Setup for nodes behind Tor

Both nodes \(the watchtower and the client\) must be behind Tor to be able to communicate.

### Tor Watchtower setup

* Change the lnd.conf:  

  `# nano /mnt/hdd/lnd/lnd.conf`

* insert the lines on the end of the file: 

  ```text
    [Watchtower]
    watchtower.active=1
  ```

* Edit the Tor config file of the watchtower:  
  `# nano /etc/tor/torrc`

  add the lines:

  ```text
    # Hidden Service for incoming LND WatchTower connections
    HiddenServiceDir /mnt/hdd/tor/lndWT9911
    HiddenServicePort 9911 127.0.0.1:9911
  ```

* restart Tor and lnd with systemctl: 
`# systemctl restart tor`  
`# systemctl restart lnd`
* Take note of the watchtower's onion address by running:  
`# cat /mnt/hdd/tor/lndWT9911/hostname`
* Take note of the watchtower-pubkey by running  
`$ lncli tower info`
* Filter the log continuously with \(CTRL+C to exit\):  
`# tail -f -n 10000 /mnt/hdd/lnd/logs/bitcoin/mainnet/lnd.log | grep WTWR`

  Example output on the watchtower side:

  ```text

  ```

### Tor Watchtower Client setup

* \[LND v0.8.0+\] Register one or more watchtower\(s\):
  * Change the lnd.conf:  

    `# nano /mnt/hdd/lnd/lnd.conf`

  * insert the lines on the end of the file:

    ```text
    [Wtclient]
    wtclient.active=1
    ```

  * restart lnd `# systemctl restart lnd`

  * Add a watchtower from the command line \(can add multiple one-by-one\):

    ```text
    $ lncli wtclient add 02b745aa2c27881f2494978fe76494137f86fef6754e5fd19313670a5bc639ea82@xjyldrwmtxtutdqqhgvxvnykk4ophz6ygr3ci4gxnnt5wibl7k4g2vad.onion:9911
    ```

    * The details of a test node are prefilled. Connections are welcome, but there is no guarantee for this service to stay online.
    * Use the `watchtower-pubkey` noted previously from `$ lncli tower info`.
    * The host is watchtower's .onion address noted previously from: `# cat /mnt/hdd/tor/lndWT9911/hostname`
* restart lnd with systemctl:  
`# systemctl restart lnd`
* Check which watchtowers are listening:  
`$ lncli wtclient towers`

  Example output:

  ```text
    {
            "towers": [
                    {
                            "pubkey": "02b745aa2c27881f2494978fe76494137f86fef6754e5fd19313670a5bc639ea82",

    }
